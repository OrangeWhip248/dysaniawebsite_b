                            <h2> Information about Claims </h2>
                            <p> Before continuing, you first must know about the two types of claims on Dysania. Read the information provided about each claim to learn more.  </p>
                            <h3> Faction Claims </h3>
                            <p> Faction claims are small claims made by nations using the factions plugin in order to protect important buildings, cities, bunkers, and more! A nations claimed region/borders can be much larger than their faction claim, so please use political claims as a basis for areas of actual control on the server. </p>
                            <h3> Political Claims </h3>
                            <p> Political claims are larger claims that encompass the borders of entire nations. Think of a political claim as a real life border. Political claims are indicated within the political map, which is always available in #political-news on the Dysania discord server. </p>
                            <h2> General Rules </h2>
                            <ol class="ollist">
                                <li> No hacking or cheats of any sort. This includes fullbright, gamma boosting clients, minimaps, and many features of the popular "Badlion Client". Please only use either an optifine or a vanillia client. </li>
                                <li> No exploits, duplication glitches, or 0 tick farms. Flying machines (as long as they do not contain tnt dupers) are allowed. </li>
                                <li> No alting or alt accounts. This applies to both the discord and Minecraft servers. Alting will result in a permanent ban and loss of any chance you may have at a ban appeal. </li>
                                <li> Don't bring in game matters into real life or vice versa. Please keep meta discussion, off topic discussion, and in game discussion separate. Please also keep real life politics out of the game. </li>
                                <li> Do not be toxic. Toxicity will be taken seriously, as we have had many incidents where the server has become not fun to play on due to toxic users. </li>
                                <li> Please do not use words or phrases that others may find rude or offensive, such as racial slurs. This helps keep the server a more enjoyable place for everyone. </li>
                                <li> Do not harass anyone. Harassment will be taken seriously and will most likely result in a permanent ban. Please do not harass staff members either. </li>
                                <li> Spam is not allowed. Breaking this rule may result in a mute or tempban. </li>
                                <li> Use each channel for its proper purpose. </li>
                                <li> Only greif or attack with cause and expect retaliation from the person you attacked. Do NOT greif or attack indiscriminately. </li>
                                <li> Do NOT attempt to greif the spawn area or anything inside or around it. </li>
                                <li> Do not advertise, be it on the discord or in game. </li>
                                <li> Do not give players who are banned on the server insight into what is going on in the server. This includes adding banned players to country dms, allowing banned players to be in Dysania - related discord servers, and providing banned players information on what is going on inside of Dysania. </li>
                                <li> Please invite new users using the discord link and not the server ip. This is to ensure that they can go through the proper vetting process, just like everyone else. </li>
                                <li> Please only invite people who you believe will be good fits for the server. Make sure they will understand the core concepts and rules of the server before sending the invite. If you wish to publicly advertise or advertise on another discord server, please ask the Admins beforehand. </li>
                                <li> No NSFW content. This includes on the discord and in maparts in game. Creating NSFW maparts will result in at least a one week tempban per mapart. Distributing and selling maparts will result in at least a 24 hour or more tempban <b>per mapart sold</b>.
                                <li> Please know that the Admins have the final say in all matters pertaining to server management </li>
                                <li> Encouraging rule breaking by others will be treated as if you are breaking the rule yourself. </li>
                                <li> Attempting to undermine the staff team's ability to catch rule breakers and enforce rules will be punished severely. It is expected that you report rule breaking and in game exploits to the admins. </li>
                            </ol>
